* HTML: hypertext (links text to hyperlinks) markup language (markers on text to form structure of code 
* Syntax of HTML Elements 

**Gaps:**

**Today's Progress**: 

* Research and preparation!
* Setup Twitter, Codecademy, and FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** 

* I am feeling excited and optimistic to do this challenge. I think that engaging with the online community (Twitter & Discord), and writing blog posts (Medium) will help keep me accountable. Initially, I was going to solely do the codecademy FED/FSE program, so I am grateful to have found this community before the end of the day. 

**Key Takeaways:** 
* HTML is the anatomy; CSS is the style; Javascript is the physiology 
* Overview of Web Development, The Internet, and FED/FSE Programming Languages
