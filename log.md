### Day 2: July 12, 2022

* Start freecodecamp: Responsive Web Design project – Submitted a header for the CatPhotoApp (5 minutes..)

**Thoughts:**
* I'll be out of town for four days, so I started to feel discouraged for beginning a challenge and not following through. I became more motivated once I decided to properly prep for this challenge by creating this Github repo. Enjoy the process.  

**Key Takeaways:** 
* HTML: hypertext (links text to hyperlinks) markup language (markers on text to form structure of code 
* Syntax of HTML Elements 

**Gaps:** 
* Practice time: Allocate more time to practice coding with freecodecamp's HTML project 
* Next: Outline the CatPhotoApp project, so I take the initiative in this project vs. just following directions
