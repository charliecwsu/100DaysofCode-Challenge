### Day 0: July 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

* Research, preparation, and setup! Learning Resources: codecademy + freecodecamp 
* This challenge will help develop the habit of coding every day this year. Repetition and consistency is key. 

**Thoughts:** 

* I am feeling excited and optimistic to do this challenge. I think that engaging with the online community (Twitter & Discord), and writing blog posts (Medium) will help keep me accountable.
